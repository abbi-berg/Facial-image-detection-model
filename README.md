# Facial-image-detection-model

This code was submitted as my final project in MIT Data Science Certificate Program

## Context:
Deep learning enables the analysis of unstructured data, including image data for emotion detection. Emotion AI focuses on developing systems that can understand and respond to human emotions by analyzing facial expressions and other cues. Accurate facial emotion recognition systems could enable mental health diagnostics, improve customer service platforms, and help businesses make decisions based on customersâ€™ perceptions of products in stores or restaurants.

## Objectives:
The objective of this project is to leverage deep learning and artificial intelligence techniques to develop a computer vision model capable of accurately detecting facial emotions. The model will perform multi-class classification on images of facial expressions, categorizing them according to the associated emotions.
